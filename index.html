        <h2 style="font-size: 28px;">Abstract</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 24px;">In this project, I selected a simple restaurant online ordering site to practice the
            workflow of redesigning a simple website. I first identified the usability problems with the website and
            then check its accessibility with WebAIM WAVE. Secondly, I utilized both low-fidelity and high-fidelity
            prototyping to visually redesign the webpage. Finally, I applied HTML and CSS to conduct a responsive
            redesign of the webpage.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Chongqing House is a popular place in Providence as one of the few local Chinese restaurants. However, my
            friends and I had to frequently order food online because of its distance from Brown University. Moreover,
            They do not work with any delivery platforms such as Uber or DoorDash, so we had to order directly from its
            custom-made ordering website.

        <h2>Original Website</h2>

            website!</a>
        <p>Go to https://www.chongqinghouseri.com/</p>
        <p>As a restaurant ordering site, I think images are more effective than words in highlighting the deliciousness
            of the food. I chose the website because I think the design is text-heavy and the layout is outdated.</p>

    <div style="color: #DEDEDE">
        <h2>Usability problems</h2>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Consistency<br>At the center of the webpage, it includes an introduction to the restaurant with the big
                title “Welcome to Chong Qing House”. However, in the detailed description, it mentions a “Tokyo
                restaurant” and “high-quality fresh sushi”, which are clearly contradictions that leave the users
                wondering if they are viewing the wrong website.
            </li>
            <li>flexibility and efficiency of use<br>The categories section on the left could provide flexibility to
                experienced users, but it might cause confusion to novice users. The users come to the website to order
                food online, so the first thing they are most likely to notice is the huge red order online button.
                After clicking the red button, it shows an identical menu to the categories section. Then, it is a bit
                weird to have two identical menus showing on screen simultaneously, and if you click the menu at the
                center of the screen, it redirects you to the same page associated with the categories section, which
                makes the red button and menu section meaningless.
            </li>
            <li>Recognition<br>If you only look at the interface and don't move the mouse over the target, it's
                difficult to notice that the poster on the right is clickable and takes you to the home page. If you are
                currently on the homepage, clicking it will have no effect. Similarly, it is not immediately evident
                that the texts in green are clickable in the working hours display.
            </li>
            <li>Error prevention<br>Although it shows “closed” in the working hours' display section, the whole process
                of online ordering is not disabled. It only offers error messages when you proceed to check out, which
                doesn’t necessarily eliminate error-prone conditions.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div style="color: #DEDEDE">
        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>According to WebAIM WAVE, there are 3 errors and 22 alerts. The webpage has a missing form label error and a
            multiple form label error, which may cause screen reader users to miss the function or purpose of that form
            control. It also has an empty button error but it is a dummy object that is invisible to the users, which I
            don’t think it will cause too much trouble. Besides, I am more interested in the alerts that are
            automatically detected. For example, it has 13 very small texts alert. As I mentioned before, the webpage is
            too text-heavy. Also, it has many redundant link errors, which take place in the working hours section. It
            links all the display time to the LOCATION&HOURS section, which I think is superfluous but not a big deal.

        <h2>Annotation</h2>
        <p>To fix the consistency error in the restaurant introduction part, I simply removed the text box and replaced
            it with a large image of Chongqing culture. I believe the image will be more appealing to the user and will
            also indicate what type of food the restaurant serves: Chinese food.</p>
        <p>For efficiency of use, I also integrated the categories section and the menu page to show the photo menu
            directly on the main page, making it easier for users to find the menu and order meals. By clicking the menu
            buttons, it will direct the users the corresponding sections such as entree or drinks. </p>
        <p>Since I have simplified the menu display, I don’t have to include the picture linked to the home page now,
            which will eliminate the recognition problem.</p>
        <p>I used both overlay and hover effects to avoid dense texts and only show the prices and names of the food if
            the users find the image of food attractive and hover over the image.</p>
        <p>Finally, I used more images to avoid small text errors. I also displayed the business hours and location at a
            less visible place because I think the most important function of the website is to order food, and most
            novice users find the online ordering site from third-party applications such as google maps or yelp, which
            already include business hours and location information. If they want to check the business hours and
            location, they can still find them somewhere on the website. And experienced users have already known the
            business hours and location, so the information is not that important. </p>

            <ol type="1">
                <li>Flexbox and grid<br>I am using a combination of flexbox and grid to make the webpage responsive to
                    different screen sizes. For example, for the four buttons (appetizers, entree, side, drinks) under
                    the menu section, I am using a flex display with a row direction, so the buttons will automatically
                    convert to two rows when the screen size is small. Similarly, for the display of menu items, I am
                    using a grid so that when the screen size changes, the number of items in the row will change
                    correspondingly. When the webpage is viewed on a desktop, there are 4 items in a row while there are
                    only 3 or 2 when the size of the screen decreases.

                </li>
                <li>Hover effect<br>The colors of buttons or elements in the navigation bar will change when the users
                    hover over them. Besides, to minimize the text on the webpage, I am using an overlay and hover
                    effect on the items in the menu, so the prices and names of the food will occur when users hover
                    over them.</li>
